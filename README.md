# Music Library App - React version

This is the React-based version of a simple music library web app. I've tried to build this using a progressive enhancement mindset, meaning that even if the JavaScript breaks (which does happen, perhaps more than we realise) the core functionality of the app still works.

This has involved server-side rendering pages, and using Node to handle server requests for URLs etc.

Therefore, this is not a standard React app like you might see elsewhere.
